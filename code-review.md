Overall, nice solutions! Just some suggestions to help you improve:
- remove unnecessary comments.
- indent your functions as per the convention. consider configuring your vs code to do auto indentation

If you do these 2 things, I think your code will be much more readable, and people looking at your code will think you're a good developer :-)
